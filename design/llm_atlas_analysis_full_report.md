## Introduction  

This document presents a comprehensive design for an **LLM-powered assistant** that helps ATLAS physicists analyze data. The assistant will accept natural language requests such as *“Plot the jet $p_T$ from dataset XYZ”* or *“Show the dimuon invariant mass from dataset ABC”* and produce a runnable analysis (code and plots). It leverages a large language model (LLM) to orchestrate tasks like dataset validation, data extraction, code generation, execution, and iterative debugging. The system is built on the IRIS-HEP analysis stack — **ServiceX**, **Rucio**, **uproot**, **awkward-array**, **vector**, and **hist** — ensuring physics-specific functionality. We describe the architecture in modular form, discuss memory/persistence, outline deployment considerations, and compare implementation approaches (OpenAI Agents vs. LangChain/LangGraph).

## High-Level System Architecture  

At a high level, the assistant functions as an **autonomous agent** supervised by an LLM. The user’s request is parsed and executed through several well-defined modules that handle specialized tasks. Below is an overview of the data flow and major components:

- **1. User Interface:** Captures the user’s natural language request (e.g. via chat or notebook cell) and passes it to the LLM-based core.  
- **2. LLM Core (Orchestrator):** Interprets the request and plans the solution. It uses tools/modules for specific actions (dataset lookup, code execution, etc.) and decides how to sequence them.  
- **3. Dataset Validation Module (Rucio):** Validates the dataset identifier provided by the user using Rucio’s data management system to ensure the dataset exists and is accessible ([ATLAS Analysis-based Software Tutorial | Introduction to Rucio](https://atlassoftwaredocs.web.cern.ch/analysis-software/AnalysisSWTutorial/rucio_intro/#:~:text=The%20basic%20unit%20in%20Rucio,not%20cover%20this%20right%20now)).  
- **4. Query Planner & Code Generator:** Translates the user’s request into a data query (using ServiceX and IRIS-HEP libraries) and generates Python code to retrieve the data and make the plot.  
- **5. Execution Engine:** Runs the generated code in a sandbox or local environment. Captures outputs (plots, data) or any errors/exceptions.  
- **6. Iterative Refinement Loop:** If execution fails or produces incorrect results, the system enters a loop: the LLM analyzes the error, consults memory or web if needed, adjusts the code, and re-runs it until success.  
- **7. Knowledge Base (Memory):** A persistent memory of past successful workflows and troubleshooting steps. The LLM can query this to avoid reinventing solutions and to *learn* new tasks over time.  
- **8. Output Assembler:** Once the code runs correctly, the assistant produces a final deliverable (a Jupyter notebook or Python script) containing the code, the resulting plot, and explanatory markdown/commentary.

Each of these components is described in detail below, along with the boundaries and interactions between modules.

## Component Design and Responsibilities  

### 1. User Request Interface  

This module handles how users input their requests and receive results. Initially this could be a simple CLI or chat interface; eventually it may be a web app or JupyterLab extension. Its responsibilities:  

- **Session Management:** Start an analysis session and maintain context (e.g. prior conversation or selected experiment context like ATLAS).  
- **Input Handling:** Forward the user’s query (e.g. *“plot jet pt from dataset XYZ”*) to the LLM core. If using a chat UI, it will format the user prompt for the LLM.  
- **Output Rendering:** Receive the final notebook/script and plot from the LLM core and display it to the user. For a notebook, this means showing nicely formatted markdown, code cells, and images of plots; for a script, it might just provide a downloadable file or text output.  

**Module boundary:** The UI is kept separate from the analysis logic. It does not perform any computation or validation itself – it simply passes the user’s request inward and delivers results back. This separation ensures the core logic can run independently of how the user interacts (facilitating future integration into different frontends).

### 2. LLM Core (Task Orchestrator)  

At the heart of the system is an LLM-driven **agent** that interprets the request and controls the workflow. The LLM (e.g. GPT-4 or a specialized model) is prompted with a system message describing its role and available tools (dataset lookup, code execution, etc.), and it receives the user’s query. Its main functions:  

- **Natural Language Understanding:** Parse the user’s request to determine the desired analysis. For example, identify that *“jet pt”* refers to jet transverse momentum and *“dataset XYZ”* is a dataset identifier. It may also infer the type of plot (histogram, scatter, etc.) from context (by default, “plot the jet pt” implies a histogram of jet $p_T$).  
- **Planning:** Decide which steps and in what order to fulfill the request. For a typical request, the plan might be:
  1. Validate the dataset ID via Rucio.
  2. Formulate a data query for ServiceX to get the needed physics quantities.
  3. Write Python code using uproot/awkward to process the data and create the plot with hist/matplotlib.
  4. Run the code.
  5. If an error occurs, debug (possibly looping back to adjust the code or query).  
- **Tool Invocation:** The LLM uses a form of **tool use API** – for example, with OpenAI function calls or a LangChain agent – to invoke other modules. It might say “Call the dataset_validation tool with argument XYZ” which triggers the Rucio module, or “Call the code_execution tool with the generated code” to run it. The LLM decides when to call these tools and uses their output to inform next steps.  
- **Reasoning & Iteration:** The LLM processes results from each step. If Rucio returns an error (dataset not found), the LLM might ask the user for clarification or try a slightly modified name. If code execution returns a stack trace, the LLM will analyze it and decide how to fix the code (e.g. import a missing library, adjust a wrong variable name, etc.). This reflective reasoning loop continues until the goal (a correct plot) is achieved.

**Module boundary:** The LLM core does not directly perform external actions or calculations – it must use tools for that. It operates by receiving observations and emitting next actions (much like a human analyst deciding what to do next). This design encapsulates all “intelligence” in one place while keeping actual operations in specialized modules.

### 3. Dataset Validation Module (Rucio Integration)  

High-energy physics data is organized in datasets identified by DIDs (Data IDs) within Rucio. The Dataset Validation module ensures a user-provided dataset identifier is valid and accessible. Its responsibilities:  

- **Rucio Lookup:** Given a dataset name or DID from the user request, query the Rucio system (via its API or CLI) to verify existence. Rucio defines a DID as a registered data identifier (which can be a single file, a dataset comprising many files, or a container of datasets) ([ATLAS Analysis-based Software Tutorial | Introduction to Rucio](https://atlassoftwaredocs.web.cern.ch/analysis-software/AnalysisSWTutorial/rucio_intro/#:~:text=The%20basic%20unit%20in%20Rucio,not%20cover%20this%20right%20now)). The module will check that the DID exists in the catalog and is available for analysis.  
- **Metadata Retrieval:** Optionally, fetch metadata like number of events or file list. This can inform how to query the data (e.g. if needed to chunk the processing). For now, the main check is existence; extended functionality could include ensuring the user has permission or the data is at a site ServiceX can access.  
- **Error Handling:** If the dataset ID is invalid or not found, the module returns a failure message. The LLM core can then decide to ask the user for a correction or attempt to search (perhaps by using wildcards or similar dataset names).  
- **Integration:** This module exposes a simple interface like `validate_dataset(DID) -> status/info`. It will be wrapped as a tool that the LLM can call. For example, the LLM might receive a boolean `True/False` or a structured response (`{"exists": True, "files": [...]}').  

By separating dataset validation, we ensure the subsequent steps don’t proceed on invalid data. It confines all Rucio-specific logic here. In future, if we extend to other experiments, we could swap out or augment this module with a CMS dataset validator (while the rest of the system remains unchanged).

### 4. Query Planner & ServiceX Request Builder  

Once the dataset is validated, the assistant plans how to extract the needed physics quantities. This **Query Planner** determines what data columns or event information are required, and uses ServiceX to retrieve them efficiently. Responsibilities include:  

- **Physics Quantity Resolution:** Map the user’s natural language quantity to actual data fields. For instance, *“jet pt”* likely corresponds to a branch like `Jet_pt` in the dataset (for ATLAS xAOD it might be in a Jets collection). *“Dimuon invariant mass”* suggests retrieving muon four-momentum components (e.g. muon px, py, pz, E or pt, eta, phi, mass) in order to compute the invariant mass of muon pairs. The assistant may have a built-in knowledge base or prompts to infer which branches are needed for a given physics concept.  
- **Formulating ServiceX Query:** Using the identified branches, the module constructs a selection query for ServiceX. ServiceX allows users to specify a **selection statement** (filters + columns) along with a dataset, and it will launch workers to extract those columns from the dataset files ([ServiceX | Institute for Research and Innovation in Software for High Energy Physics](http://iris-hep.org/projects/servicex.html#:~:text=ServiceX%20is%20a%20data%20extraction,easy%20analysis%20using%20familiar%20tooling)). The assistant can use a high-level query language (funcADL or similar) which ServiceX supports ([ServiceX | Institute for Research and Innovation in Software for High Energy Physics](http://iris-hep.org/projects/servicex.html#:~:text=are%20spun%20up%20to%20filter,simple%20calculations%20of%20derived%20values)). For example:  
  - If the user asks for a jet $p_T$ histogram, the query might be: “Select all jet four-vectors, then project out the pt of each jet”. This could translate to a `func_adl` expression like:  

    ```python
    query = "lambda e: e.Jets('AntiKt4EMTopoJets').pt()"
    ```  

    This tells ServiceX to retrieve the **pt** of every jet in every event.  
  - For dimuon mass, the query might select events with at least two muons and return the muon kinematics. (E.g., “for each event, get the four-momentum of muons”). The invariant mass can be computed client-side after data delivery.  

- **ServiceX Dataset Invocation:** The module will call ServiceX with the dataset DID and the query. In code, this uses the `ServiceXDataset` API from the IRIS-HEP stack. For example (pseudo-code):  

  ```python
  from servicex import ServiceXDataset
  ds = ServiceXDataset(dataset_id="XYZ", backend_type="xaod")  
  result = ds.deliver(query)  # submit the transform request 
  ```  

  The `deliver()` method will trigger the ServiceX transformation. Behind the scenes, ServiceX uses experiment-specific code (C++ or Python) to skim the data. It produces output in a convenient format (Parquet files or ROOT files) and can even load results as Python objects. Notably, ServiceX can deliver data as **Awkward Arrays** in Python for immediate use ([ServiceX | Institute for Research and Innovation in Software for High Energy Physics](http://iris-hep.org/projects/servicex.html#:~:text=%2A%20Extracts%20data%20from%20experiment,store%20or%20to%20%2036)). This means the assistant can get a Python object (like an awkward array of jet $p_T$ values) without manually handling files.  

- **Efficiency Considerations:** The planner tries to push filters into the ServiceX query when possible to minimize data transfer. For example, if the request were *“jets with $p_T > 20$ GeV”*, it would include that cut in the selection statement so that only relevant data is returned. This utilizes the *“filter and projection”* capabilities of ServiceX’s backend to reduce data volumes ([ServiceX | Institute for Research and Innovation in Software for High Energy Physics](http://iris-hep.org/projects/servicex.html#:~:text=The%20files%20located%20by%20the,simple%20calculations%20of%20derived%20values)).  
- **Alternate Path (Uproot):** In cases where ServiceX is unavailable or if the dataset is small, the assistant could fall back to using **uproot** directly to read files. Uproot is a Python library for reading ROOT files natively. The module might then obtain file locations from Rucio (or rely on the user’s environment where files are accessible) and use uproot to read branches. However, the primary design uses ServiceX for its distributed, on-demand data delivery.

**Module boundary:** This Query Planner is a logical component usually executed by the LLM (via its reasoning). In implementation, much of this is handled in the prompt or in code generation rather than a distinct subroutine – but conceptually it isolates *what data to get*. It interacts with ServiceX through its Python client, encapsulating the IRIS-HEP logic of data retrieval so that the rest of the code (analysis and plotting) deals with in-memory arrays rather than grid data management.

### 5. Analysis Code Generation Module  

With a data access plan in place, the assistant now generates the actual **Python code** that will: fetch the data, compute any derived quantities, and produce the requested plot. This module is essentially the LLM “coding” in Python, assembling calls to the analysis libraries in the correct sequence. Key aspects:  

- **Using IRIS-HEP Tools:** The code will make heavy use of the IRIS-HEP analysis ecosystem:  
  - **Awkward Array:** to manipulate nested data structures. For example, the jets $p_T$ from ServiceX might come as an *awkward array* of shape (n_events, n_jets_per_event). The code may use `ak.flatten(array)` to merge all jets into one flat array for histogramming, or apply masks to select certain jets. Awkward enables vectorized operations on the data (like computing new arrays without explicit Python loops).  
  - **Vector Library:** to compute physics vector operations. If the task is to find invariant mass of dimuon pairs, the code will use the `vector` library to create Lorentz vector objects for muons and sum them. For example:  

    ```python
    import vector  
    mu_vecs = vector.arr({'pt': mu_pt, 'eta': mu_eta, 'phi': mu_phi, 'E': mu_energy})  
    dimuon = mu_vecs[0] + mu_vecs[1]  # combine first two muons in event  
    mass = dimuon.mass  
    ```  

    If multiple events, this would be done in an array context (perhaps using awkward to handle all events in one go). The LLM needs to generate the correct usage (ensuring the vector library is installed and imported).  
  - **Histogramming (Hist):** to aggregate data into a histogram and plot it. The `hist` library (built on boost-histogram) provides a convenient way to create histograms. The code might define an axis with appropriate range and bins, fill it with the data, and then use a plotting function. For example:  

    ```python
    import hist  
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  
    h = hist.Hist.new.Reg(50, 0, 200, name="Jet $p_T$ [GeV]").Double()  
    h.fill(jet_pt=ak.flatten(jet_pts_ak_array))  
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()  
    h.plot(ax=ax)  
    ```  

    This would produce a histogram of jet $p_T$ with 50 bins from 0 to 200 GeV. For a dimuon mass, the range might be set to, say, 0–120 GeV to cover the J/ψ to Z-boson region. The assistant also labels axes appropriately.  
  - **Matplotlib/Plotting:** In addition to using `hist.plot` or similar, the code ensures the plot is rendered (e.g., calling `plt.show()` if in a script, or just outputting the figure in a notebook environment). It may also add titles or legends based on the request (e.g., “Dimuon Invariant Mass”).  

- **Code Structure:** The generated code is organized for clarity and reusability. It typically includes:  
  1. **Imports:** for all necessary packages (servicex, uproot, awkward as `ak`, numpy, hist, vector, matplotlib, etc.).  
  2. **Dataset & Query Setup:** e.g., define the dataset identifier (from the user input) and the query. Possibly also include a print of what is being done for transparency.  
  3. **Data Retrieval:** call ServiceX to get the data. This might be a synchronous call that returns when data is ready. For large requests, asynchronous patterns could be used, but initially assume the data is fetched within the runtime of the session. The result could be an awkward array or a dictionary of file paths. If file paths, the code then uses `servicex_analysis_utils.to_awkward()` (or uproot) to load them into an awkward array.  
  4. **Data Processing:** manipulate the awkward arrays to compute derived quantities. For example, for dimuon mass, the code would loop (vectorized) over events with at least two muons and calculate pairwise masses. The LLM might use awkward’s broadcasting or combinations (e.g. `ak.combinations`) to get all muon pairs. It will filter or pick the first pair as needed.  
  5. **Histogramming & Plotting:** fill a histogram object or use numpy to bin the data, then produce a plot. It ensures the plot is labeled and formatted.  
  6. **Display/Save Plot:** In a notebook context, simply displaying the figure suffices. If a standalone script, maybe save the plot image to a file.  
  7. **Markdown/Comments:** The assistant will intersperse the code with explanations. In a notebook output, this means creating separate Markdown cells that explain each step (data loading, processing, etc.), effectively documenting the analysis. In a pure script output, it would include rich comments above code blocks describing what is happening. This addresses the requirement for the assistant to *output explanations in markdown or comments*, making the result educational and clear.  

- **Example Generated Code Snippet:**  
  For a request *“Plot the jet pt from dataset XYZ”*, a simplified excerpt of the generated notebook might look like:  

  ```markdown
  **Dataset**: Using ATLAS dataset `XYZ`. We will retrieve all jet transverse momenta (`pT`) and plot their distribution.
  ```  

  ```python
  import servicex
  import awkward as ak
  import hist
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

  # Define dataset and query for jet pT
  dataset = servicex.ServiceXDataset("XYZ", backend_name="xaod")  
  query = "lambda e: e.Jets('AntiKt4EMTopoJets').pt()"  
  # Request data as an awkward array
  result = dataset.deliver(query)  # triggers ServiceX transformation
  jets = servicex_analysis_utils.to_awkward(result)[\"XYZ\"]  # load to awkward (jagged array of jets per event)

  # Flatten all jets from all events and plot pT
  all_jet_pts = ak.flatten(jets)  
  h = hist.Hist.new.Reg(50, 0, 200, name="Jet $p_T$ [GeV]").Double()
  h.fill(all_jet_pts)
  fig, ax = plt.subplots()
  h.plot(ax=ax)
  ax.set_xlabel("Jet $p_T$ [GeV]")
  ax.set_ylabel("Number of jets")
  plt.show()
  ```  

  ```markdown
  *Figure:* Histogram of jet transverse momentum for all jets in dataset `XYZ`.  
  ```  

  This dummy example illustrates how the assistant combines ServiceX for data access and the IRIS-HEP libraries for analysis. In actual usage, the code might be more complex (checking for errors, etc.), but the structure remains modular and clear.  

**Module boundary:** The Code Generation is handled by the LLM using its learned knowledge of programming and the domain-specific libraries. It is *separated from execution* – i.e., the code is prepared as text, but not run within this module. This separation allows the system to inspect or modify the code before execution if needed (for example, to insert monitoring hooks, or to ensure it is safe). In practice, this module’s output is passed to the Execution Engine. If needed, a code formatter or validator could also be applied here (e.g., to ensure syntax is correct, although the LLM is usually relied on to produce correct code).

### 6. Execution Engine and Iterative Refinement  

The Execution Engine is responsible for running the generated code in a controlled environment and feeding the results (or errors) back to the LLM core for evaluation. Its key responsibilities and design choices:  

- **Sandboxed Code Execution:** The engine will execute the code in an isolated environment. In a local setup, this might just be a subprocess or a Jupyter kernel. For safety (especially on a server deployment), this should be a sandbox, such as a Docker container or a restricted Python environment, to prevent malicious code execution or accidental damage (the assistant’s code is supposed to be analysis-focused, but since an LLM is writing it, we add this safety net). The environment will have the necessary libraries installed (IRIS-HEP stack, matplotlib, etc.).  
- **Result Capture:** The engine captures the outputs of the code. This includes:
  - **Plot Image:** If a plot was shown, the engine grabs the figure image (for a notebook, the figure would be displayed; for script, we might save and open it).  
  - **Console Output:** Any printed text or warnings.  
  - **Execution Logs:** If the code ran successfully or if it threw exceptions.  
- **Error Handling:** If the code fails (raises an exception or exits with error), the engine collects the traceback and error message, and passes that back to the LLM core. Importantly, the engine does not attempt to fix anything itself — it just reports what happened.  

Once the execution completes, the system checks if the outcome is as expected. Here the **Iterative Refinement Loop** kicks in under the control of the LLM core:  

- If the code ran correctly and produced a plot, the loop ends. The final outputs go to the user.  
- If there was an error or the output is not correct, the LLM analyzes the feedback:
  - The LLM may have chain-of-thought prompts allowing it to reason about the error. For example, an error “NameError: name 'servicex_analysis_utils' is not defined” clearly indicates a missing import or installation, which the LLM can deduce and fix by adding `import servicex_analysis_utils` or installing that package.
  - Another example: an error like “AttributeError: 'DataFrame' object has no attribute 'pt'” might indicate the ServiceX returned a Pandas DataFrame instead of awkward array, so the code’s expectation was wrong. The LLM can adjust by handling DataFrame output or forcing awkward.  
- **Consulting Knowledge Base:** Before blindly trying a fix, the LLM will search the internal memory for similar error messages or tasks. Perhaps in a past session, it encountered the same issue and a solution is stored (like *“if servicex returns a DataFrame, use `.to_awkward()` function”*). If a relevant solution snippet is found in the knowledge base, the LLM incorporates that directly ([Langchain Agents vs Langgraph](https://www.softgrade.org/langchain-agents-vs-langgraph/#:~:text=As%20Langchain%20,stop%20iterating%20on%20a%20solution)). This reduces repeated trial-and-error for known issues as the assistant “learns” over time.
- **Web Search (Fallback):** If the error is novel and not in memory, the assistant can perform a web search (through a tool) to find clues. For instance, searching a specific exception or how to use a library. It might find a StackOverflow answer or documentation snippet. The LLM can then integrate that information to modify the code. (Web access might be disabled in some deployments for security, but the design allows it as a powerful resource. This is done only after checking internal memory, to prefer known trusted fixes first.)  
- **Asking the User:** If the above steps fail (or if the issue is ambiguous, such as needing a physics decision), the LLM will ask the user for guidance. For example, *“The dataset doesn’t contain a muon collection – do you want to use electron data instead, or did you specify the correct dataset?”* or *“I’m not sure how to interpret ‘XYZ’ dataset format. Could you clarify if it's xAOD or a Derived NTuple?”*. User input can then guide the assistant to resolve the issue. Human-in-the-loop is crucial for cases where the AI lacks context or permissions (and the architecture allows pausing for user feedback when needed).  

- **Refinement Iteration:** After determining a fix strategy, the LLM edits the code. This might involve inserting a library import, changing a function call, adjusting a loop, etc. The updated code is then sent again to the Execution Engine. This loop (code -> run -> error -> fix -> code) continues until the code executes without runtime errors and the results seem plausible. The design allows multiple iterations, though in practice we aim to converge in a small number of tries by leveraging stored knowledge and the LLM’s reasoning. (Using a framework like LangGraph, we can explicitly put a loop around these steps ([Langchain Agents vs Langgraph](https://www.softgrade.org/langchain-agents-vs-langgraph/#:~:text=Enter%20Langgraph,is%20built)), rather than depending on unpredictable open-loop agent behavior.)

**Module boundary:** The Execution Engine remains strictly an executor; it does not contain business logic about *how* to fix errors or interpret results. That logic lives in the LLM core (or the memory/web resources it consults). This separation ensures that any improvements in reasoning or new knowledge don’t require changing the execution module — which could be a standardized service (e.g., a Jupyter kernel service). It also means the executor can be swapped (for example, to run code on a remote server or a different environment) without retraining or altering the LLM’s approach.

### 7. Knowledge Base and Persistent Memory  

A standout feature of this assistant is its ability to **learn new tasks and remember** how to do them later. The Knowledge Base module provides long-term memory and cross-session persistence:  

- **Storage of Workflows:** Each time the assistant successfully completes a task (especially if it had to solve a new problem), it stores a representation of that solution. This could include the user request, the final code, and metadata like encountered errors and how they were fixed. For instance, after handling *“plot dimuon invariant mass”* once, it saves the fact that it needed to retrieve `muon_pt, muon_eta, muon_phi, muon_mass` branches and use vector addition to get the mass. Next time a similar request arises, the assistant can recall this workflow instead of starting from scratch.  
- **Semantic Indexing:** The memory is indexed in a way that the LLM can query it. A practical implementation is using a **vector database** or embeddings: the assistant can convert the user’s request (or an error message) into an embedding and retrieve the closest past instances. For example, an error “KeyError: 'Jet_pt'” might retrieve a memory that in another dataset the branch was named `"jetPt"` instead. Or a query *“electron energy spectrum”* might retrieve a similar “muon energy spectrum” solution that can be adapted.  
- **Content of Memory:** The knowledge base may store various artifacts:
  - *Past code snippets:* actual code that solved a problem, with annotations. The LLM might even directly incorporate a snippet (with necessary tweaks) if it’s very similar to current needs.
  - *Troubleshooting Q&A:* e.g., “If dataset is not found, try adding correct scope to the DID name.” or “If memory error occurs, use chunked processing.”
  - *User preferences:* potentially, if a user corrected the assistant or provided a custom solution, the system could remember that for that user in future sessions. (This suggests a user-specific memory in addition to a global memory of general solutions.)
- **Persistence:** This memory is stored on disk or database such that even if the system is restarted or a new session begins on a different day, the knowledge is retained. This could be a simple JSON or YAML storage for prototypes, graduating to a database or cloud store in deployment. We ensure not to rely solely on the LLM’s internal weights for learning; instead we explicitly save knowledge, which is more transparent and updatable.  
- **Maintenance:** The memory store might be periodically reviewed or curated to remove incorrect information or duplicates, and to incorporate improvements. This could be done by developers or via a feedback mechanism (perhaps the assistant can evaluate which solutions work consistently).  
- **Scope and Security:** Since this assistant could be used by multiple people, we consider separating **global knowledge** (general solutions, physics methods) from **private data** (like a user’s specific analysis context). The architecture could have a global knowledge base that all instances share, and a user/session-specific memory for personal context. This prevents, for example, one user’s proprietary analysis logic from automatically being given to another user. For the scope of this design, we focus on the global knowledge for generic tasks.

**In summary**, the memory module turns ad-hoc problem solving into cumulative learning. Over time, the assistant should become faster and more reliable as it has more prior art to draw from. This addresses the requirement that the assistant *“learn how to perform new tasks and store the resulting workflows in memory”*.

### 8. Output Assembly and Presentation  

After successful code execution, the assistant composes the final outputs for the user. This involves:  

- **Consolidating the Notebook/Script:** If running in a Jupyter-style session, the assistant will have built up a series of Markdown and code cells. It ensures these are in the correct order and well-formatted. For a script, it will combine the code with inline comments. In both cases, the result includes textual explanation and the plot image.  
- **Attaching Plot Results:** The plot generated by the code is included (e.g. as an embedded image in a notebook, or saved as an image file referenced in a markdown report). The architecture allows the Execution Engine to return binary outputs (images) which the UI can render.  
- **Documentation:** The assistant might add a summary or conclusion cell. For example, “Above, we see the dimuon invariant mass distribution, with a peak near 91 GeV corresponding to the $Z$ boson.” This is not strictly requested by the user, but adds value. Such commentary can be seen as the assistant’s interpretation of the results, and can be optional or toggled.  
- **Error Reporting:** If ultimately the assistant could not fulfill the request (even after user input), the output would include a graceful explanation of what went wrong or what information is needed. However, the goal is to handle most scenarios through the iterative loop before giving up.

This final assembly is the only component the user directly sees. It hides all the back-and-forth that may have happened (unless the user wants a verbose log). The design emphasizes clarity and readability here, per the user’s formatting requirements.

## Memory and Persistence Considerations  

To ensure robust operation, the system design carefully handles state, memory, and persistence:  

- **Session Memory:** During a single session (conversation), the LLM will have conversational context. This can include the user’s initial request, any follow-up clarifications, and the assistant’s own prior outputs. Techniques like ChatGPT-style conversation memory or LangChain’s ConversationBufferMemory can be used so the LLM remembers what it has done so far in the session. This prevents it from, for example, re-validating the dataset unnecessarily or forgetting what the user asked for. Session memory is typically kept in RAM (or within the LLM’s context window) and is reset when the session ends.  

- **Long-Term Persistence:** As detailed in the Knowledge Base section, the system stores learned information to disk or database. This is critical for *cross-session memory*. The persistence layer could be:
  - A **database** (SQL or NoSQL) keyed by task or error signature.
  - A **vector store** (for semantic search of relevant knowledge).
  - Flat files or a wiki that the assistant can search when needed (even if just via the web search tool loopback).
  
  The persistent memory is updated at the end of a session (or during, when a solution is found) to include new discoveries. It’s loaded at system startup to be available for queries.

- **Isolation of Memory:** We also consider that some memory (like user-specific notes or preferred plot styles) might be tied to a user account. In a multi-user deployment, each user might have a separate memory profile for personalized experience, in addition to the global knowledge base. The architecture would then include a **User Profile** component that stores user-specific settings or past queries.

- **Scalability of Memory:** As the knowledge base grows, searching it should remain efficient. Using embedding-based retrieval scales well (vector search in sub-linear time for large corpora). We also ensure that the LLM doesn’t try to load the entire memory into its prompt (which would be impossible for large knowledge) – instead, it will do targeted lookups. For example, upon encountering a new task, it formulates a search query like *“dimuon mass procedure”* to fetch the relevant snippet, and only injects that into its context. This keeps the prompt size manageable.

- **Persistence of Notebooks/Outputs:** Apart from knowledge, the outputs generated (like notebooks) may also be saved on a server for record-keeping. If a user wants to revisit a past analysis, having the notebook stored is helpful. This can be handled by the UI layer or an attached storage service.

- **Fault Tolerance:** In case the system crashes or restarts mid-task, having persisted intermediate state can help resume work. For example, the system might checkpoint the last generated code or results. However, a simpler approach is to just restart the conversation (the user can repeat the request). Proper logging (detailed below in deployment notes) also helps reconstruct what happened if needed.

In summary, memory in this system has two roles: **short-term conversation context** for coherence, and **long-term knowledge retention** for continual learning. Both are crucial for an assistant that improves over time and provides a seamless user experience across sessions.

## Future Deployment and Server-Side Considerations  

While the initial design might be prototyped locally, the system is intended to be deployed as a service (for multiple users and possibly long-running operation). Key deployment considerations include:  

- **Microservice Architecture:** Each module can be deployed as a separate service or combined depending on scaling needs:
  - The **LLM Orchestrator** could be a service that interacts with an LLM API (OpenAI, etc.) or hosts a fine-tuned model. This service would manage prompts and tool calling logic.
  - The **Rucio Validation** could run on a server with network access to Rucio (and proper authentication, e.g., grid certificates or tokens). It might be packaged as a small web service or simply an internal library call if the orchestrator runs in an environment where Rucio is accessible.
  - **Code Execution** might be the most resource-isolated service: for security and scalability, you could spin up a container (with the analysis environment) per user request. Technologies like Kubernetes can manage a pool of execution pods where the code runs. This ensures one user’s code can’t interfere with another’s and allows scaling compute resources independently of the LLM’s resources.
  - **Result Storage/Delivery:** The generated notebook or results could be stored in an object storage (like an S3 bucket or database) and a link provided, or directly streamed back to the UI if small.

- **LLM Model Hosting:** If using an external API (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4), the deployment needs internet access and careful handling of data sent (ensuring no sensitive data leaks). Alternatively, for privacy, one might host an open-source model locally. The architecture allows either; using LangChain or similar, one can swap the model backend without changing the overall logic.

- **Authentication and Security:** If deployed to users, access control is needed. Users might need to authenticate to use the service, especially since they will indirectly be using Rucio and possibly other privileged resources. The assistant might need its own credentials to fetch data (or it might use the user’s credentials). Ensuring the code execution environment doesn’t allow privilege escalation is important (hence container sandbox and perhaps disabling dangerous Python modules). Logging of actions (for audit, especially any data access) will be necessary in a production environment.

- **Latency and Async Operation:** Some user requests might trigger heavy data fetches (imagine a dataset with millions of events). ServiceX can handle large requests, but they take time (minutes to hours). The design can accommodate asynchronous execution:
  - The assistant might acknowledge the request and inform the user that it is running and will return when done.
  - The Execution Engine or ServiceX call could run in background and periodically update the LLM or a status. With LangGraph or a custom workflow, we could have a state where the agent waits or checks on job completion (possibly via polling or callbacks from ServiceX).
  - In a web app deployment, one might implement a job queue: the LLM does initial planning, submits the data query, then either waits or yields a “pending” result to the UI, and when ready, completes the notebook. (This is similar to how some long-running AI tasks are handled with job IDs and webhooks).
  
- **Scalability:** For many simultaneous users or requests, components should scale horizontally:
  - Multiple instances of the LLM orchestrator (behind a load balancer) could handle different sessions, especially if each uses stateless calls to an API.
  - The Execution Engine can be replicated as needed since each run is independent.
  - The Rucio/ServiceX backends are external services that also scale (ServiceX itself is a cluster-backed service ([ServiceX | Institute for Research and Innovation in Software for High Energy Physics](http://iris-hep.org/projects/servicex.html#:~:text=Architecture)), and Rucio is a distributed system).
  - Caching layer: If many users request the same dataset/quantity, ServiceX’s caching of results ([ServiceX | Institute for Research and Innovation in Software for High Energy Physics](http://iris-hep.org/projects/servicex.html#:~:text=,easy%20straightforward%20reuse%20of%20data)) can be leveraged – the assistant might check if a result is cached and reuse it, saving time.
  
- **Monitoring and Logging:** A deployed system should have monitoring on:
  - Success/failure rates of the assistant’s analyses.
  - Performance of each step (time to validate, time to get data, time to generate code, execution time).
  - This can help identify bottlenecks (for example, if code execution is frequently failing due to memory issues, the container size might need adjustment).
  - Logs of LLM decisions (perhaps in a truncated form) can help developers refine prompts or add new knowledge to prevent repeated failures.

- **Continuous Learning Deployment:** As the assistant learns new tasks, deploying those updates to all instances is important. If using a central knowledge base, that’s naturally shared. If we fine-tune the LLM or update its prompt based on new insights, we would roll out a new model or prompt version. This suggests version control on the agent’s prompt and possibly A/B testing new strategies.

- **Extensibility to Other Domains:** The design is largely domain-agnostic aside from the tools. To support other physics analyses (or even other fields), we can register new tools or knowledge. For example, to support CMS experiment data, we’d integrate their dataset system (perhaps still Rucio, since CMS also uses Rucio now, but maybe different formats) and use appropriate libraries (the rest of the stack like uproot/awkward still apply to any ROOT-based data). Because modules are decoupled, adding a new *Dataset Validation* for a new source or a new *Computation library* (say a different histogramming tool) can be done without overhauling the whole system. This modularity in deployment means one could even run separate microservices for different experiment contexts and direct the LLM to use the correct ones.

In short, the architecture is cloud-ready and designed for **scalability, security, and maintainability**. Early versions might run locally for one user (with the LLM calling local functions), but the end goal is a robust server-side application where scientists can offload tedious analysis scripting to this AI assistant reliably.

## Implementation Approaches: OpenAI Agents vs. LangChain/LangGraph  

There are multiple ways to implement the above design. We compare two popular approaches for building LLM-driven agent systems – using OpenAI’s native agent (function-calling) capabilities, versus using the LangChain framework (and its LangGraph extension). Both approaches can accomplish the task, but differ in flexibility and complexity.

### Using OpenAI Function-Calling (Agents)  

OpenAI’s recent models (e.g. GPT-4) support a **function calling** mechanism, which allows the developer to define a set of functions the model can invoke. This can naturally implement our tool-using agent without external frameworks. Key points for this approach:  

- **Function Definitions:** We define Python functions corresponding to our tools/modules, and provide their signatures to the model. For example:  

  ```python
  def validate_dataset(name: str) -> dict: 
      # calls Rucio to check dataset, returns {'exists': bool, 'detail': str}
  
  def fetch_data(query: str, dataset: str) -> str:
      # calls ServiceX and returns a reference or path to data (or an identifier)
  
  def execute_code(code: str) -> dict:
      # runs the code, returns {'success': bool, 'output': output_text, 'error': error_text}
  
  def search_web(query: str) -> str:
      # performs a web search and returns summary (if allowed)
  ```  

  These function definitions (names, parameters, docstrings describing what they do) are sent to the LLM in the system prompt. The LLM can then output a JSON object like `{"function": "validate_dataset", "arguments": {"name": "XYZ"}}` when it decides to use a tool. The developer’s code intercepts this and actually calls `validate_dataset`, then returns the result to the model. This loop continues.
- **Agent Loop:** The pattern of the model reasoning, calling a function, getting result, and continuing is managed by our code. For instance, the model’s prompt might include few-shot examples of how to decide on calling tools. The OpenAI agent will dynamically plan. For example, initial model output might be “I should validate the dataset first” and it triggers `validate_dataset`. After getting result, the model sees the dataset is valid and then might respond with something like “Now I will fetch the data via ServiceX” -> triggers `fetch_data`, and so on. The developer wraps this in a loop until the model indicates it’s done (usually by returning a final message instead of a function call).  
- **Code Generation & Execution:** The actual code to perform analysis could be generated by the model as a string (which our `execute_code` function runs), or we could break it down further (the model could call smaller functions like `plot_histogram(data)` etc.). However, given the user’s request for a notebook/script output, it’s likely we let the model produce the full code and markdown in one go after gathering info. So the sequence might be:
  1. Model calls `validate_dataset` -> get OK.
  2. Model calls `fetch_data` with an appropriate query -> gets confirmation or data reference.
  3. Model internally formulates the code (it might do this in its “thought” and then output final answer).
  4. Model returns final answer containing markdown+code. *Alternatively*, we let the model call `execute_code(code)` with a code string, and we loop if errors occur: the `execute_code` function returns error text which the model sees, then it can attempt a fix by calling `execute_code` again with a revised code. This is a design choice: letting the model handle iterative debugging via function calls can work, but it requires the model prompt to encourage trying again on error. (This is akin to AutoGPT’s style).
- **Strengths:** Using OpenAI’s native approach is relatively straightforward to set up and can leverage the full power of GPT-4’s reasoning. It requires less initial code (LangChain is a dependency we can avoid if doing manually). The model can dynamically decide the flow – for example, it might skip steps if unnecessary. Also, OpenAI models are optimized for this function calling pattern, making it quite effective for tool use.
- **Weaknesses:** The flow is somewhat a black-box: the model decides when to stop or how to handle loops. We can impose some structure (like always call execute_code and check result), but we rely on prompt engineering to get the desired control. Ensuring reliability can be tricky; as one observer noted, “using agents in production is harder… they’re so free and hard to control” ([Langchain Agents vs Langgraph](https://www.softgrade.org/langchain-agents-vs-langgraph/#:~:text=But%20using%20agents%20in%20production,the%20algorithm%20is%20so%20dynamic)). The function-calling agent might unpredictably try something not allowed or get stuck without a clear way to loop. Also, if we want to inject a human approval step, it’s not straightforward with the raw API (aside from letting the model ask and then halting until user input arrives). In summary, OpenAI’s approach is powerful for prototyping and simple to get started, but may require careful prompt tuning to handle complex multi-step flows.

- **Dummy Example (OpenAI function-calling):**  
  Below is a conceptual snippet showing how one might set up the OpenAI agent loop for our assistant (simplified):  

  ```python
  import openai

  functions = [
      {
        "name": "validate_dataset",
        "description": "Check if an ATLAS dataset (DID) exists in Rucio.",
        "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"name": {"type": "string"}}}
      },
      # ... similarly define fetch_data, execute_code, search_web
  ]
  messages = [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a physics analysis assistant ... (tools described)"}]
  messages.append({"role": "user", "content": "Plot the jet pt from dataset XYZ."})

  # Main loop
  while True:
      response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(model="gpt-4-0613", messages=messages, functions=functions)
      reply = response['choices'][0]['message']
      if reply.get("function_call"):
          func_name = reply["function_call"]["name"]
          args = json.loads(reply["function_call"]["arguments"])
          result = globals()[func_name](**args)   # call the corresponding Python function
          messages.append(reply)  # model's request
          # truncate result if too large
          messages.append({"role": "function", "name": func_name, "content": str(result)})
          continue  # loop back to give model the result
      else:
          # final answer from model
          final_answer = reply['content']
          break

  print("Assistant answer:", final_answer)
  ```  

  This pseudo-code shows the structure: the assistant will call `validate_dataset("XYZ")`, get the result, then possibly proceed to call other functions, and finally return an answer which includes the code and explanation. We would augment `execute_code` to handle iterative calls if code fails (likely the model would call `execute_code` and if it sees an error in the returned content, it can call it again with modifications, as part of the same loop). This highlights that with OpenAI’s agent, the logic is implicit in the model’s behavior rather than explicitly coded by us.

### Using LangChain and LangGraph  

**LangChain** is a framework that provides tools to build LLM applications, including agent behavior with tool use. **LangGraph** is an extension of LangChain that allows designing the agent’s decision flow as a directed graph (with nodes and conditional edges), giving more control over the sequence of actions. Here’s how we can implement our assistant with these:  

- **Tools in LangChain:** LangChain has a notion of `Tool` objects, which are essentially functions with descriptions that an agent can call. We would create Tool wrappers for our functional modules:

  ```python
  from langchain.agents import Tool

  validate_tool = Tool(
      name="validate_dataset",
      func=lambda name: rucio_client.validate(name),
      description="Validate if a dataset ID exists via Rucio."
  )
  fetch_tool = Tool(
      name="fetch_data",
      func=lambda dataset, query: servicex_client.fetch(dataset, query),
      description="Fetch data from a dataset using ServiceX with a given query."
  )
  execute_tool = Tool(
      name="execute_code",
      func=run_code,  # run_code would be a function to execute code and return output
      description="Execute analysis Python code and return result or errors."
  )
  search_tool = Tool(
      name="search_web",
      func=web_search_api,
      description="Search the web for information."
  )
  ```  

  LangChain agents use these tool definitions to decide actions, similarly to OpenAI’s function calling but with an extra layer that can handle formatting and parsing. We would likely use a **ReAct** style prompt (Reason + Act) where the model is prompted to think step-by-step, then choose a tool action.
- **Memory in LangChain:** LangChain provides memory modules for chat history and can integrate with vector stores for long-term memory. We can use `ConversationBufferMemory` for the session conversation, and `VectorStoreRetriever` as a tool or in-context knowledge base. For example, we might add another tool:

  ```python
  memory_tool = Tool(
      name="search_memory",
      func=lambda query: knowledge_base.search(query),
      description="Search the internal knowledge base for hints or past solutions."
  )
  ```  

  The agent could be prompted to use `search_memory` whenever it faces an error or unfamiliar task before resorting to `search_web`.
- **LangGraph for Structured Flow:** Rather than relying purely on the agent’s reasoning to loop on errors, **LangGraph** enables explicit flow control. We could define a graph like:
  - Node1: LLM call with instruction to validate dataset (and allowed to use only `validate_dataset` tool). If dataset invalid -> branch to Node1b to ask user for new dataset (human in loop).
  - Node2: LLM call that formulates the data query (could be part of code generation step; uses `fetch_data` tool to perhaps get a quick schema or confirmation).
  - Node3: LLM call to generate code (the prompt here would encourage outputting full code). Then automatically go to Node4.
  - Node4: Execute the code with `execute_code` tool. If execution returns error -> go to Node5; if success -> go to Node6.
  - Node5: LLM call to analyze error (allowed tools: `search_memory`, `search_web` possibly). It produces a fix or an updated code. Loop back to Node4 to execute again. (This loop can have a counter or a condition to break after e.g. 3 attempts or on user intervention).
  - Node6: Finalize output. Possibly an LLM call to generate a closing message or verify the plot is ready.

  Using LangGraph, these nodes and edges are defined explicitly in code, giving **deterministic structure** to the agent. For example, a LangGraph definition (pseudo-code) might look like:

  ```python
  from langchain.graphs import Graph, Node

  graph = Graph()
  node_validate = Node(prompt="User requested {request}. Verify dataset {dataset} exists.", tools=[validate_tool])
  node_on_invalid = Node(prompt="Dataset {dataset} not found. Ask user for a correct ID.", human_input=True)
  node_generate = Node(prompt="Dataset valid. Plan query and generate analysis code for {request}.", tools=[fetch_tool, memory_tool], next=node_execute)
  node_execute = Node(prompt="Now executing code.", tools=[execute_tool], next_conditional=[
      (lambda result: "error" in result, node_fix),
      (lambda result: "error" not in result, node_finish)
  ])
  node_fix = Node(prompt="The code failed with error: {error}. Analyze and fix it.", tools=[memory_tool, search_tool], next=node_execute)
  node_finish = Node(prompt="Code succeeded. Present final notebook.", tools=[], end_of_flow=True)
  graph.start = node_validate
  ```  

  This dummy outline shows how one could structure the flow. LangChain’s actual API for LangGraph might differ, but conceptually this is the idea. Each node can use a specialized prompt to focus the LLM on that step. For instance, the prompt at node_fix might encourage the LLM to output only the corrected code snippet or an explanation.

- **Example Dummy Code using LangChain agent:**  
  If we didn’t go full LangGraph, we could still use a standard LangChain agent with ReAct. For example:  

  ```python
  from langchain import OpenAI
  from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, AgentType

  llm = OpenAI(model="gpt-4")
  tools = [validate_tool, fetch_tool, execute_tool, search_tool, memory_tool]
  agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True)
  
  # The agent will use the tool descriptions to decide actions
  result = agent.run("Plot the jet pt from dataset XYZ")
  print(result)
  ```  

  This would use a generic prompt like: *“You are an agent. You have access to the following tools: [list]. When given a task, you should think step by step and decide the best action…”*, etc. The agent’s reasoning (if `verbose=True`) might look like:
  1. *Thought:* "The user wants a plot of jet pt from XYZ. I should verify the dataset exists."
     *Action:* `validate_dataset("XYZ")` → gets True.
  2. *Thought:* "Dataset is valid. Next, I need to fetch jet pt data. I'll use ServiceX."
     *Action:* `fetch_data("XYZ", "lambda e: ... .pt()")` → returns perhaps a path or object reference.
  3. *Thought:* "Data fetched. Now I write the code to plot it."
     *Action:* The agent might either directly return the code (as the final answer), or call `execute_code`:
     `execute_code("... code string ...")` → if error, it sees output and goes on.
  4. *Thought:* "Got an error about missing import. I'll fix that."
     *Action:* `execute_code("... modified code ...")` → success.
  5. *Thought:* "Code succeeded, I'll return the final result."
     *Final Answer:* (markdown + code + possibly base64 image if returning as text).

  The above happens within the single `agent.run()` call, abstracted by LangChain. This approach works, but as noted, complex loops are harder to control – which is why LangGraph (or manual graph as above) would be considered for production to insert clear conditional branches and limit the agent’s wandering.

- **Pros of LangChain/LangGraph:** It offers a structured way to build the agent. We can easily swap in different LLMs if needed (e.g. test on GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4, or even a local model via HuggingFace integration). The framework provides many utilities: out-of-the-box memory integration, logging, and even experiment tracking (LangSmith) which can be valuable for iterating on prompt designs. Most importantly, LangGraph gives the ability to encode the loop and conditional logic explicitly ([Langchain Agents vs Langgraph](https://www.softgrade.org/langchain-agents-vs-langgraph/#:~:text=Enter%20Langgraph,is%20built)), which increases reliability. For example, we can ensure that after 3 failed code attempts, we automatically escalate to asking the user (rather than hoping the LLM does so). We can also hold certain state variables (like the error message) and pass them along, rather than relying on the LLM to remember the exact error text. This aligns with the idea that *“LangGraph enables granular control over the agent's thought process”* ([Langchain Agents vs Langgraph](https://www.softgrade.org/langchain-agents-vs-langgraph/#:~:text=loops%20in%20the%20flow%20to,is%20built)) by managing state and flow in a programmable way.  
- **Cons:** LangChain introduces additional complexity and learning curve. It may require familiarity with its abstractions, and sometimes the abstraction can be limiting or need customization. Also, running a LangChain agent still relies on an LLM under the hood, so one must ensure the prompts and tools are well-defined – LangChain doesn’t automatically solve the problem, it just provides structure. Another consideration is that LangChain’s overhead might add latency (although typically small compared to LLM inference). Finally, debugging an agent can be tricky in either approach; LangChain does have good verbose logging which helps, whereas a raw OpenAI loop we’d have to instrument ourselves.

### Summary of Approaches  

**OpenAI Agents (Function Call)**: Quick to implement using the model’s capabilities directly, good for prototyping and leveraging GPT’s own planning. However, less deterministic control – essentially the LLM “figures out” the flow each time. In a prototyping scenario, this is excellent to see how the model behaves with the given tools ([Langchain Agents vs Langgraph](https://www.softgrade.org/langchain-agents-vs-langgraph/#:~:text=As%20Langchain%20,stop%20iterating%20on%20a%20solution)), but in a production scenario we might want more guardrails.

**LangChain/LangGraph**: Provides a framework to impose a structure on the agent’s behavior and manage state between tool calls. This helps meet enterprise-grade expectations for reliability (for example, ensuring data privacy by controlling what is sent to the LLM, as pointed out in discussions on agent constraints ([Langchain Agents vs Langgraph](https://www.softgrade.org/langchain-agents-vs-langgraph/#:~:text=But%20using%20agents%20in%20production,the%20algorithm%20is%20so%20dynamic))). LangGraph’s ability to insert human check-points or loops is valuable for our assistant, which explicitly requires looping on errors and possibly asking the user for input. In essence, *agents are great for prototyping*, but a controlled graph can ensure the assistant stays on track and handles edge cases gracefully ([Langchain Agents vs Langgraph](https://www.softgrade.org/langchain-agents-vs-langgraph/#:~:text=In%20short%2C%20agents%20are%20great,take%20to%20the%20next%20step)).

Both approaches ultimately can achieve the same end-user functionality. In fact, one could start with an OpenAI function-calling prototype and later refactor into a LangGraph workflow as the requirements solidify. The example/dummy code snippets above illustrate how each might look in practice.

## Clear Use of the IRIS-HEP Analysis Stack  

To avoid any ambiguity, here is a summary of how each IRIS-HEP tool is utilized in the assistant’s operation:  

- **Rucio:** Used in the Dataset Validation module to confirm dataset existence. Rucio’s role is purely in metadata management and file location; the assistant uses it to avoid invalid requests. (If needed, the assistant could also retrieve file paths from Rucio for a fallback uproot method, but typically ServiceX abstracts that away by accepting a Rucio DID directly.)  
- **ServiceX:** The primary data delivery engine. Given a dataset DID and a selection (columns + optional filters), ServiceX distributes the task of reading those columns from all files in the dataset across many workers and delivers the result in an analysis-friendly form ([ServiceX | Institute for Research and Innovation in Software for High Energy Physics](http://iris-hep.org/projects/servicex.html#:~:text=ServiceX%20is%20a%20data%20extraction,easy%20analysis%20using%20familiar%20tooling)) ([ServiceX | Institute for Research and Innovation in Software for High Energy Physics](http://iris-hep.org/projects/servicex.html#:~:text=The%20files%20located%20by%20the,simple%20calculations%20of%20derived%20values)). The assistant interacts with ServiceX via its Python client, essentially outsourcing the heavy lifting of data extraction. This enables near real-time analysis on large distributed data (a key IRIS-HEP innovation).  
- **uproot:** A Python library for reading ROOT files, used implicitly when ServiceX returns data. For example, ServiceX may provide a set of root files or use uproot under the hood to convert to awkward arrays ([ServiceX | Institute for Research and Innovation in Software for High Energy Physics](http://iris-hep.org/projects/servicex.html#:~:text=The%20Qastle%20queries%20are%20translated,is%20executed%20by%20the%20transformers)). If the assistant ever has to open a file directly (like reading a small user-provided file), it would use uproot to get branch arrays. uproot seamlessly integrates with awkward-array.  
- **Awkward Array:** Central to handling HEP data in Python, awkward-array is used for manipulating the structured data (jagged arrays of particles, etc.). The assistant’s generated code will employ awkward for selecting subsets of data (e.g., “events with >=2 muons”), flattening nested arrays (e.g., all jets), computing new arrays (e.g., an array of invariant masses), and so on. Awkward allows these operations in a vectorized fashion, making the analysis efficient in Python. The integration of ServiceX with awkward means the assistant can get awkward arrays directly ([ServiceX | Institute for Research and Innovation in Software for High Energy Physics](http://iris-hep.org/projects/servicex.html#:~:text=%2A%20Extracts%20data%20from%20experiment,store%20or%20to%20%2036)), making the pipeline smooth.  
- **vector:** The physics vector library is used to handle vector kinematics conveniently. Instead of manually computing invariant mass with formulas, the assistant uses `vector` to treat collections of (pt, eta, phi, mass) as Lorentz vectors and perform additions or other operations. This not only simplifies code but reduces errors in calculations. For example, computing a dimuon invariant mass becomes a few lines with `vector` (as shown earlier) rather than handling trig functions and square roots.  
- **hist (Hist & boost-histogram):** This library is used to create histograms of the data and provides an interface for plotting. The assistant uses `Hist` to define axes (with proper binning and labels) and then fills them with numpy/awkward arrays of values. The result is a histogram object that can be rendered with matplotlib. Using `hist` is advantageous because it inherently handles weighted counts, underflow/overflow bins, and can produce nicer plots. However, for simplicity, the assistant might also use matplotlib’s `plt.hist` directly for a quick histogram if appropriate – but since the user explicitly mentioned the stack including `hist`, we ensure to demonstrate it.  

By utilizing these tools, the assistant stands on the shoulders of well-maintained HEP libraries, which means the code it generates is using community-accepted best practices. In essence, the LLM assistant is glueing these tools together in response to a natural language query, automating what a physicist would manually script in a typical analysis environment.

## Conclusion  

In this design, we presented a detailed architecture for an LLM-powered ATLAS analysis assistant. The system is composed of modular components that handle everything from understanding user intent to delivering a polished analysis notebook. Memory and learning capabilities are built-in so that the assistant improves over time, preserving workflows and troubleshooting knowledge across sessions. We also ensured the design aligns with the IRIS-HEP analysis ecosystem, leveraging cutting-edge tools like ServiceX for data delivery and awkward arrays for efficient in-memory analysis.

Looking forward, this architecture is flexible enough to be extended beyond the specific examples (jet $p_T$, dimuon mass) to a wide range of physics analysis tasks. By swapping or adding tools, it could support different experiments or data formats, illustrating a clear path to scalability. The comparison of implementation approaches highlights that while one can start quickly with a powerful LLM and basic tools, achieving reliability and maintainability will benefit from frameworks like LangChain/LangGraph that give more control over the agent’s behavior.

In summary, the proposed system marries the generative capabilities of modern LLMs with the domain-specific power of HEP analysis libraries. It aims to streamline the cycle of dataset query → analysis code → result, allowing physicists to interact with their data in a higher-level, conversational manner. With careful engineering, such an assistant could significantly accelerate the exploration and visualization of physics data, while continuously learning from each interaction to become an even more effective aide.
