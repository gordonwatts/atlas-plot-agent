# Atlas Plot Agent

Atlas Plot Agent is a tool designed to facilitate the creation and management of plots for data analysis within the ATLAS framework. It streamlines the generation of plots and provides an easy-to-use interface for scientists and engineers working in high-energy physics.

The above is what I'd like it to become. That statement is 100% aspirational.

## Features

As things get implemented, I'll add them here.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

### Installation

## Usage

To start this using the web interface do the following:

```bash
streamlit run ./atlas_plot_agent/cli.py web
```

And to run this from the command line (with a cli interaction):

```bash
python ./atlas_plot_agent/cli.py ask "Plot the jet pT for all jets in mc23_13p6TeV:mc23_13p6TeV.801167.Py8EG_A14NNPDF23LO_jj_JZ2.deriv.DAOD_PHYSLITE.e8514_e8528_a911_s4114_r15224_r15225_p6697"
```
