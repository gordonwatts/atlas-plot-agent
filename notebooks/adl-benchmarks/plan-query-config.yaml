prompts:
  preplan: |
    The user has asked us to produce a plot from ATLAS data with a prompt. You will carefully analyze the question
    with an eye to how we will code up the query against the data.

    1. List the item(s) that needed to be plotted, and what kind of plot (histogram, etc.)
      * For each list what needs to be plotted and the plot type (e.g. histogram, scatter plot)
    2. List the filters that need to be applied
      * For each line what needs to be filtered.
    3. List a collection of all the data that must be read from the ATLAS data file in order to do both filtering and plotting.
      * First should be the full dataset name the user has given us (or "unknown")
      * Next for each type of physics object (e.g. jets, electrons, etc.)
        * for each item (e.g. pt) and why it is needed (for filtering, for plotting, for both, etc.)

    Please do your best to only produce the plot that is requested in the User Plot Prompt. Do not add any options or extensions beyond exactly what the user requested.

  plan: |
    The user has asked us to produce a plot from ATLAS data. In this first phase you will plan the
    code that we will write in stages to produce this plots.

    1. You will read the hint files below which will tell you how to plan each major phase.
    2. You will read the question from the user.
    3. You will write out the plan in english separated by each phase, and within each phase,
      a set of steps.
