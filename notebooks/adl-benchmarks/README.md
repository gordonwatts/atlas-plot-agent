# ADL Benchmarks

The files in this folder contain examples of using various AI systems to generate code for the [ADL benchmarks](https://github.com/iris-hep/adl-benchmarks-index).

## Process

1. The AI is asked a slightly modified question (see below).
1. The result is pasted into the notebook
1. The example is updated until it runs, with a log kept of what changes had to be made.

The top of each file discusses configuration of each of the tools.

## Questions

See the original [site](https://github.com/iris-hep/adl-benchmarks-index) for the raw version of the questions. Of course, those questions were never meant to be fed to an AI, so some further context (e.g. datasets) had to be added. The questions are listed below:

1. Plot the ETmiss of all events in the rucio dataset mc23_13p6TeV:mc23_13p6TeV.801167.Py8EG_A14NNPDF23LO_jj_JZ2.deriv.DAOD_PHYSLITE.e8514_e8528_a911_s4114_r15224_r15225_p6697.
1. Plot the pT of all jets in the rucio dataset mc23_13p6TeV:mc23_13p6TeV.801167.Py8EG_A14NNPDF23LO_jj_JZ2.deriv.DAOD_PHYSLITE.e8514_e8528_a911_s4114_r15224_r15225_p6697.
1. Plot the pT of jets with |η| < 1 in the rucio dataset mc23_13p6TeV:mc23_13p6TeV.801167.Py8EG_A14NNPDF23LO_jj_JZ2.deriv.DAOD_PHYSLITE.e8514_e8528_a911_s4114_r15224_r15225_p6697.
1. Plot the ETmiss of events that have at least two jets with pT > 40 GeV in the rucio dataset mc23_13p6TeV:mc23_13p6TeV.801167.Py8EG_A14NNPDF23LO_jj_JZ2.deriv.DAOD_PHYSLITE.e8514_e8528_a911_s4114_r15224_r15225_p6697.
1. Plot the ETmiss of events that have an opposite-charge muon pair with an invariant mass between 60 and 120 GeV in the rucio dataset mc23_13p6TeV:mc23_13p6TeV.513109.MGPy8EG_Zmumu_FxFx3jHT2bias_SW_CFilterBVeto.deriv.DAOD_PHYSLITE.e8514_e8528_s4162_s4114_r14622_r14663_p6697.
1. For events with at least three jets, plot the pT of the trijet four-momentum that has the invariant mass closest to 172.5 GeV in each event and plot the maximum b-tagging discriminant value among the jets in this trijet in the rucio dataset mc23_13p6TeV:mc23_13p6TeV.601237.PhPy8EG_A14_ttbar_hdamp258p75_allhad.deriv.DAOD_PHYSLITE.e8514_s4369_r16083_p6697.
1. Plot the scalar sum in each event of the pT of jets with pT > 30 GeV that are not within 0.4 in ΔR of any light lepton with pT > 10 GeV in the rucio dataset mc23_13p6TeV:mc23_13p6TeV.601237.PhPy8EG_A14_ttbar_hdamp258p75_allhad.deriv.DAOD_PHYSLITE.e8514_s4369_r16083_p6697.
1. For events with at least three light leptons and a same-flavor opposite-charge light lepton pair, find such a pair that has the invariant mass closest to 91.2 GeV in each event and plot the transverse mass of the system consisting of the missing transverse momentum and the highest-pT light lepton not in this pair in the rucio dataset mc23_13p6TeV:mc23_13p6TeV.701005.Sh_2214_lllvjj.deriv.DAOD_PHYSLITE.e8543_s4159_r15224_p6697.

Note: these DID's had files in them when the tests were run! Sample deletion comes for us all!
